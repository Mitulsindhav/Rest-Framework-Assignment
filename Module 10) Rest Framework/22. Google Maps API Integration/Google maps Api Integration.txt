(1) Using Google Maps API to display maps and calculate distances 
    between locations.

  - The Google Maps API is a collection of web services provided by Google
    that allows developers to embed maps and integrate geolocation
    functionalities into websites and applications. Two primary components
    used for visual mapping and distance calculation are the Maps 
    JavaScript API and the Distance Matrix API.

  1. Displaying Maps Using Maps JavaScript API
   - The Maps JavaScript API enables developers to embed dynamic, 
     interactive maps into web applications.

  - Key Concepts:
    - Map Rendering: A map is embedded within a webpage and can be styled,
      zoomed, and panned.

    - Markers: Points of interest can be marked on the map.

    - Customization: Maps can be customized in terms of controls, styles,
      and overlays.

    - User Interaction: Users can click, zoom, or drag the map, and 
      developers can handle these events.
 
  - Use Cases:
    - Showing the location of a business or event

    - Displaying routes or delivery tracking

    - Visualizing user check-ins or nearby points of interest

  2. Calculating Distances Using Distance Matrix API
  -  The Distance Matrix API provides travel distance and time for a 
     matrix of origins and destinations.

 - Key Concepts:
    - Origins and Destinations: You can specify multiple starting and
      ending points.

    - Modes of Travel: Supports driving, walking, bicycling, and public 
      transport.
 
    - Traffic Considerations: Can include real-time traffic data (for 
      driving mode).

    - Distance & Duration: Returns both estimated distance and time 
      required.

 - Use Cases:
    - Finding the nearest store, branch, or warehouse

    - Calculating delivery times

    - Route planning and optimization in logistics apps

-=> Benefits of Using Google Maps APIs
   - Reliable & Accurate Data: Google Maps provides comprehensive and 
     up-to-date geographic data.

   - Scalability: Suitable for small websites as well as large-scale 
     enterprise applications.

   - Customizability: Developers can tailor the appearance and behavior 
     of maps to their needs.

   - Integration: Easily integrates with other services like geocoding, 
     places, and directions APIs.
-=>  Security and Access
   - Requires an API key obtained from Google Cloud Console.

   - API keys should be secured by restricting usage to specific domains 
     or IP addresses.

   - Google Maps Platform follows a pay-as-you-go billing model with  
     free tier limits.
