(1) Introduction to REST Countries API and how to retrieve country-specific
    data. 
 -  The REST Countries API is a free, public RESTful web service that
    provides comprehensive data about countries around the world. It is 
    commonly used in educational projects, data analysis, location-based
    services, and travel-related applications.
  
  - Purpose and Use
   - The REST Countries API allows developers to access structured and 
     reliable country information using simple HTTP requests. It is 
     particularly useful for:

      - Displaying country information in dropdowns or forms

      - Populating dashboards or reports with geographic data

      - Building apps involving travel, culture, or international data

 -  Key Features
  - The API returns various types of country-specific information,
    including:

     - Country Name (official and common names)

     - Capital

     - Region and Subregion

     - Population and Area

     - Languages

     - Currencies
 
     - Borders (neighboring countries)

     - Country Code (ISO alpha-2, alpha-3)

     - National Flag (as a URL)

 - Structure and Access
   - RESTful Design: Follows REST principles using standard HTTP methods
     (mostly GET).

     - Stateless: Each request is independent; the server doesnâ€™t retain
       session information.

 - Common Use Cases
  1. Fetching All Countries:
   - Useful for displaying all country names or creating a searchable list.

  2. Fetching by Country Name or Code:
   - Allows users to query specific countries based on name or ISO code.

  3. Filtering by Region or Language:
   - Helpful for regional studies, language-based sorting, or travel
     applications.

  4. Fetching Flags and Symbols:
   - Supports cultural or visual applications by providing links to 
     flags and emblems.
