(1)Adding pagination to APIs to handle large data sets.
 - In the context of APIs, pagination is a technique used to split large
   datasets into smaller, manageable parts (pages) for better performance 
   and user experience. Instead of returning all data in a single response,
   which can be inefficient and slow, pagination allows the API to return 
   a subset of data per request.

=> Why Use Pagination?
 
 - Performance: Large datasets can lead to slow response times. Pagination 
   ensures that the data is served in smaller chunks, reducing the load on
   the server and the client.

 - Memory Efficiency: Fetching large datasets can consume a lot of memory.
   Pagination helps by loading only a subset of the data at a time.

 - User Experience: Paginated responses allow clients to only fetch the
   data they need, enhancing the speed and usability of applications,
   especially when dealing with long lists (e.g., product catalogs, search
   results).

 - Scalability: As datasets grow over time, pagination helps ensure that
   the API continues to function efficiently even as the amount of data 
   increases.

 => Pagination Methods in APIs

 - There are several common strategies for implementing pagination in APIs:

 1.Offset-based Pagination (Limit-Offset):

 - In this approach, the client specifies two parameters: limit (the number
   of items per page) and offset (the starting point).

 - Example: /items?limit=10&offset=20

 - This would fetch the 21st to 30th items in the dataset.

 - Pros: Simple and easy to implement.

 - Cons: Performance can degrade when navigating large datasets, especially
   if records are inserted or deleted, causing the offset to shift and 
   leading to potential issues with data consistency.

 2.Page-based Pagination (Page Number):

 - This method divides the data into pages. The client specifies the page
   number and the number of items per page.

 - Example: /items?page=2&size=10

 - This would fetch the second page with 10 items per page.

 - Pros: Intuitive for users and clients.

 - Cons: Similar to offset pagination, it can become less efficient for 
   large datasets.

 3.Cursor-based Pagination:

 - Cursor-based pagination uses a unique cursor (usually an ID or 
   timestamp) to track the position of records. This cursor is sent back 
   by the server with each response, and the client uses it to request 
   the next set of records.

 - Example: /items?cursor=abc123

 - Pros: More efficient than offset-based pagination, especially when 
   dealing with large datasets that change over time (like continuously 
   updated data). It avoids the issues of gaps or duplicates caused by 
   record insertion/deletion.

 - Cons: More complex to implement, as it requires maintaining a cursor 
   for the position in the data.

 -> Key Components of Paginated API Responses
    Regardless of the pagination method, a paginated API response 
    typically contains:

	1.Results: The actual data (subset of the full dataset) that the client 
     requested.

	2.Count: The total number of items available (useful for showing the
     user how many total items exist).

  3.Next: The URL to fetch the next page of results (if available).

	4.Previous: The URL to fetch the previous page of results 
    (if applicable).


-> Benefits of Pagination in APIs

 - Reduces Overload: Prevents overwhelming the client and server by 
   sending data in smaller chunks.

 - Improves User Experience: Clients can load data incrementally, improving
   performance and responsiveness.

 - Easier to Manage: Pagination makes it easier to manage large sets of 
   data on the backend, as each request fetches only a small portion of 
   the dataset.
