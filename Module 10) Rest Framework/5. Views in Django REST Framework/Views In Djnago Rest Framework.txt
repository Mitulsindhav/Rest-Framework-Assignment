 
 ***  Views in Django REST Framework   *** 

(1) Understanding views in DRF: Function-based views vs Class-based views.
 -  Views in DRF define how to handle requests and return responses. DRF 
    supports both Function-Based Views (FBVs) and Class-Based Views (CBVs),
    each with their own strengths.
  
  1.Function-Based Views (FBVs)
  
  - These are simple Python functions that use DRF's decorators to handle
    HTTP methods.

  - Key Features:
  
   - Easier to understand for beginners.

   - Great for simple logic and quick endpoints.

   - Uses @api_view decorator. 
  
  2.Class-Based Views (CBVs)
  
  - These use Python classes to organize logic. DRF provides base classes 
    like APIView and generic views for common patterns.

  - Key Features:
   - More reusable and modular.

   - Supports multiple methods in one class (get(), post(), etc.).

   - Easier to extend with mixins and generics.
