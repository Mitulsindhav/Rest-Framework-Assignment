(1) Introduction to OpenWeatherMap API and how to retrieve weather data.  
  * Introduction to OpenWeatherMap API
  - OpenWeatherMap is a widely used API service that provides real-time
    weather data, forecasts, and historical weather information. It 
    allows developers to integrate weather data into applications,
    websites, and services, offering a range of endpoints for various 
    types of weather-related information.

-=> What OpenWeatherMap API Offers
  - The OpenWeatherMap API provides several endpoints for different 
    weather data:

   1. Current Weather:
    - Retrieve the current weather conditions for a specific city or 
      geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

   2. 5-Day/3-Hour Forecast:
    - Get weather forecasts for the next five days, with data available 
      every 3 hours.

   3. Hourly Forecast:
    - Obtain a more detailed forecast, including weather data for each
      hour.

   4. Historical Data:
    - Retrieve past weather data for a specific location, including 
      temperature, humidity, and other weather conditions.

   5. Weather Alerts:
    - Get notifications for extreme weather conditions (e.g., storms,
      hurricanes).

   6. Air Pollution:
    - Provides data on air quality, including concentrations of pollutants
      like CO, NO2, SO2, etc.

-=>  How the OpenWeatherMap API Works
   1. API Key:
    - To access the OpenWeatherMap API, you must first sign up and obtain
      an API key. This key is used for authentication and ensures that API
      usage is tracked.

   2. API Endpoints:
    - OpenWeatherMap offers different endpoints based on the type of data 
      you need (current weather, forecast, etc.). For example:

    - Current Weather Endpoint:  
      - https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

    - 5-Day Forecast Endpoint: 
      - https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast

   3. Parameters:
   -  API requests include parameters such as:

      - City Name (q=London)

      - Geographical Coordinates (lat=35.6895&lon=139.6917)

      - API Key (appid=your_api_key)

      - Units (units=metric for Celsius, units=imperial for Fahrenheit)

   4. Response:
    - The API responds in JSON format, containing weather data 
      (temperature, wind speed, conditions, etc.) or forecast information
      for the requested location.
