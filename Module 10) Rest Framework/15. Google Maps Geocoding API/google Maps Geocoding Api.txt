(1) Using Google Maps Geocoding API to convert addresses into coordinates.
-=> Using Google Maps Geocoding API to Convert Addresses into Coordinates    
    The Google Maps Geocoding API allows you to convert addresses into
    geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), making it an 
    essential tool for location-based services in applications. This API
    helps in handling addresses and mapping them to geographic locations,
    enabling features like mapping, distance calculations, and spatial
    analysis.

-=> How Google Maps Geocoding API Works
   1. API Key:
    - To use the Geocoding API, you need an API key which can be obtained
      from the Google Cloud Console. This key authenticates your requests 
      and is required to access the service.

   2. Geocoding Request:
    - A geocoding request involves sending an HTTP request to the Google
      Maps API, passing in the address you want to geocode. The API will 
      then respond with the latitude and longitude of that address.

-=> Components of a Geocoding API Request
  - address:
   - This is the address that you want to geocode (e.g., "1600 
     Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA").

  - key:
   - This is your personal API key provided by Google to authenticate
     your requests.

  - optional parameters:

   - language: You can specify the language for the response (e.g., en 
     for English).

   - region: Specifies the region code, which helps narrow down the 
     search results (e.g., US for the United States).

   - components: Use this to restrict the search to specific countries,
     postal codes, or administrative areas.

-=> API Response
   - The response from the Geocoding API is typically in JSON format. For
     a given address, the API will return a set of results with 
     geographical coordinates and other related data.

   - The response will contain:

   1. Location Data:
    - The latitude and longitude of the address in the geometry.location 
      field.

   2. Formatted Address:
    - A human-readable version of the input address.

   3. Address Components:
    - This provides detailed parts of the address, such as street number,
      locality, administrative areas, and country.
