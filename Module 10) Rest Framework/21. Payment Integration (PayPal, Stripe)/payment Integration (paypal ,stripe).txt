(1) Introduction to integrating payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe. 
  - Integrating a payment gateway is essential for applications that 
    involve e-commerce, subscriptions, donations, or any form of online
    monetary transactions. Two of the most widely used and developer-
    friendly payment gateways are PayPal and Stripe.

-=> What Is a Payment Gateway?
  - A payment gateway is a service that authorizes and processes payments 
    (typically via credit/debit cards, bank accounts, or digital wallets)
    between a customer and a business. It acts as a bridge between the
    application and the payment proces

-=>  Basic Flow of Payment Gateway Integration
  1. User Initiates Payment

   - From your application (e.g., “Pay Now” button).

  2. Payment Gateway Interface

   - Redirects to or embeds a secure checkout page (e.g., PayPal popup 
     or Stripe Elements).

  3. Payment Authorization

   - User enters payment information (card, wallet, etc.).

   - Gateway securely encrypts and validates the data.

  4. Transaction Processing

   - Payment is authorized and processed via the bank/card issuer.

  5. Response Handling

   - Gateway returns a response (success/failure).

   - Application updates records, shows confirmation, or handles errors.

  6. Webhook Notifications

   - Optionally, use webhooks to receive real-time updates about 
     payment status (e.g., successful, refunded, failed).
