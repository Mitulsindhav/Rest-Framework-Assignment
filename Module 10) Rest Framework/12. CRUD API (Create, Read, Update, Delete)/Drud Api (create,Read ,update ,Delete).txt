(1) What is CRUD, and why is it fundamental to backend development?
  * What is CRUD?
  - CRUD stands for the four basic operations used to manage data in
    applications:

  - Create – Add new data (e.g., a new user)

  - Read – Retrieve data (e.g., view user profile)

  - Update – Modify existing data (e.g., change password)

  - Delete – Remove data (e.g., delete account)

  - These actions are used in nearly every database or backend application.

  * Why is CRUD Fundamental to Backend Development?

  - CRUD is essential because it defines how the backend interacts with 
    the database. Here's why it matters:

   1. Core of Data Management
   -  Most backend systems revolve around storing and manipulating data —
      whether it's user info, products, posts, etc. CRUD provides the 
      standard way to do that.

   2. Mapped to HTTP Methods
   -  In REST APIs, CRUD maps directly to HTTP methods:


   - HTTP Method	CRUD Operation
   - POST	Create
   - GET	Read
   - PUT/PATCH	Update
   - DELETE	Delete
   - This makes it easy to design predictable and organized APIs.

   3. Database Interaction
   -  CRUD aligns with SQL commands:

   - INSERT for Create
 
   - SELECT for Read

   - UPDATE for Update

   - DELETE for Delete

   - So CRUD is how your backend talks to the database.

   4. Foundation for Features
   -  Whether you're building a blog, an e-commerce site, or a social
      network, CRUD powers key features like:

   -  Registering/logging in users

   -  Managing products or orders

   -  Creating and editing posts

   5. Universal Design Pattern
   -  CRUD is framework-agnostic — it's used in Django, Flask, Node.js,   
      Laravel, and beyond. Once you learn it, you can apply it to any
      backend stack.
