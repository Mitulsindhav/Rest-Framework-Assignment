(1) Introduction to Twilio API for sending SMS and OTPs. 
  - The Twilio API is a powerful cloud communications platform that enables
    developers to send SMS, voice calls, and OTPs (One-Time Passwords) via
    programmable APIs. It is widely used in web and mobile applications 
    for secure user verification and communication.

-=> What is Twilio?
  - Twilio is a cloud-based service that provides APIs for:

     - Sending SMS/MMS messages

     - Making and receiving voice/video calls

     - Sending WhatsApp messages

     - Delivering OTP codes for authentication

     - Managing phone number verification and more

-=>  Common Use Case: OTP (One-Time Password)
   - An OTP is a short-lived code sent to a user via SMS or voice to
     verify their identity during:

       - Registration

       - Login (2FA)

       - Password recovery

       - Secure transactions

-=> How Twilio API Works (Conceptual Flow)
  1. Sign Up and Setup

   - Create a Twilio account.

   - Verify your phone number.

   - Get a Twilio phone number (used to send messages).

   - Generate an API Key or use your Account SID and Auth Token for
     authentication.

  2. Compose Your Message

   - Define the message content (e.g., "Your OTP is 123456").

   - Specify the recipientâ€™s phone number and your Twilio number.

  3. Send SMS via API

   - Use a POST request to the Messages API endpoint.
 
   - Authenticate with your SID and Auth Token.

   - Pass the sender number, receiver number, and message text as
     parameters.

 4. OTP Verification (Optional)

  - Use Twilio Verify API for managing OTP generation and validation
    securely.

  - Twilio handles OTP code creation, delivery, and expiration.

 5. Track Delivery

  - Monitor delivery status via Twilio's dashboard or callback webhooks.

  - Handle errors like undelivered messages or invalid numbers.
