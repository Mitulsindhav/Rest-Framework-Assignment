(1) Using email sending APIs like SendGrid and Mailchimp to send
    transactional emails.
 -  Transactional emails are automated, real-time messages sent to
    individuals based on specific actions or events — for example, 
    password resets, order confirmations, or OTPs. Tools like SendGrid 
    and Mailchimp Transactional (formerly Mandrill) provide robust APIs 
    for sending these emails reliably and at scale.

-=> What Are Transactional Emails?
  - Transactional emails are event-driven messages sent to a single 
    user based on interactions with an app or website. Examples include:

     - Registration confirmations

     - Password reset links

     - Purchase receipts or invoices

     - OTP (One-Time Password) messages

     - Account notifications

-=>  How These APIs Work (Conceptually)
  1. Setup:

    - Sign up for a SendGrid or Mailchimp account.

    - Create and verify a sender domain or email address.

    - Generate an API key for secure authentication.

  2. Compose Email Content:

    - Create reusable templates using dynamic placeholders 
      (e.g., {{username}}, {{otp}}).

    - Templates are stored and managed via the provider’s dashboard.

  3. Send API Request:

    - Use a RESTful POST request to the provider’s email endpoint.

    -  Include:

       - Recipient details (To, CC, BCC)

       - Subject

       - Content (HTML or plain text)

       - Data to populate dynamic fields (e.g., username, order ID)

       - API Key for authentication

  4. Response Handling:

   - API returns a success or error status.

   - Optionally log or display response data (e.g., message ID).

  5. Track and Analyze:

  - Use built-in analytics to monitor:

       - Delivery status

       - Open rates

       - Clicks

       - Bounce or spam reports
