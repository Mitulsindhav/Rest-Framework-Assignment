(1) What is an API (Application Programming Interface)? 
-> An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules 
   and protocols that allow different software applications to 
   communicate with each other.

-> In simple terms:
   Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant. You (the user) tell 
   the waiter what you want, the waiter goes to the kitchen (the system)
   ,and brings back your order (the result). You don’t need to know how 
   the kitchen works—you just interact with the waiter (the API).

 * Key Points:
   Interface: It provides a way for different systems or components
   to interact without knowing the internal workings.

   Request and Response: APIs usually work by sending requests 
   and receiving responses—commonly using HTTP.

   Data Format: Most APIs use data formats like JSON or XML.

(2)Types of APIs: REST, SOAP.

 1.REST (Representational State Transfer)

-=>Characteristics:

 - Uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

 - Stateless: Each request from a client to server must contain all 
   the  information needed to understand and process the request.

 - Uses URLs to access resources (like /users/1 to get user with ID 1).

 - Data Format: Primarily JSON (can also use XML, HTML, etc.).

 - Lightweight and faster.

 2.SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

=> Characteristics:

 - Protocol-based: Strict standards.

 - Communicates via XML only.

 - Works over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.

 - Has built-in security (WS-Security) and supports transactions.

 - Requires a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file to describe 
   the service.

(3)Why are APIs important in web development? 
 - APIs are crucial in web development because they allow different 
   systems, services, and applications to work together efficiently. 
   Here's why they're so important:

 1.Communication Between Systems
 - APIs allow front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) to talk 
   to each other.

 - Example: A React website (front-end) gets user data from a Django 
   or Node.js API (back-end) without exposing the internal logic.

 2.Integration with Third-Party Services
 - APIs let you use services like:

 - Google Maps for location

 - Stripe for payments

 - Firebase for authentication

 - OpenWeather for weather info

 - You don’t need to build everything from scratch. Just connect via API.

 3.Reusable and Modular Code
 - APIs make your app modular. One API can serve multiple platforms: 
   web, mobile, or desktop apps.

 - Write your logic once in an API, and reuse it everywhere.

 4.Decoupling Frontend and Backend
 - APIs allow independent development of frontend and backend.

 - Frontend team can build UI using dummy API responses.

 - Backend team can focus on logic and data.

 - This speeds up development and makes apps easier to maintain and scale.

 5.Security and Access Control
 - APIs can enforce authentication, authorization, and rate limits, 
   protecting your system from unauthorized access.

 - Example: Only logged-in users can access /user/profile API.

 6.Automation and Scalability
 - APIs make automation possible—think of bots, cron jobs, microservices,
   or machine-to-machine communication.

 - Automate reports, data sync, and workflows through APIs.
